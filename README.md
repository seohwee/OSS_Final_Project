This is a **WordPress** website developed with **Raspberry Pi** for the **Final Project** in **Open Source Software Lab** class.

**All In One! Enjoy the convenience of getting information from this site, as well as planning your destination and schedule!**


# What does this project do? 
This project is based on CMS(Contents Management System) using WordPress developed by Raspberry Pi. This project allows myself to make my own website that provides information on traveling to Japan that I wanted to share with various people. Through this project(my website), users will be able to earn information, thus finding interesting figures that they have never seen in existing traveling sites. 


# This site provides users with: 
> 1. travel guide and information based on experiences and information accumulated over the 8 years of living in Japan.
> 2. Weather information in Japan.
> 3. Travel schedule
> 4. Reviews from travelers.
